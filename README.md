# reverse-template [![Build status](https://travis-ci.org/twolfson/reverse-template.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/twolfson/reverse-template)

Reverse templating library, generating variables from a template's output

This is a fork from [`reverse-mustache`][] and was initially intended to be for handlebars. However, it turns out the language is even more complex for reversal.

## Getting Started
Install the module with: `npm install reverse-template`

```javascript
var reverse_template = require('reverse-template');
reverse_template.awesome(); // "awesome"
```
